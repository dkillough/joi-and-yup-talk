            Form validation occurs at the form level of your web application, this validation
            enables frontend to pre-validate before sending a request to the api server.

            Form validation can save a wasted round trip therefore keeping wasted cpu cycles 
            off of the server load. It can also provide specific insight into what is invalid.

            But it is not the best UX, especially for large forms, it requires the user to scan
            through several errors and fields.
