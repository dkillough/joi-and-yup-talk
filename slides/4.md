          Server-Side validation is the process of validating the data once received through the API. 
          This validation serves as a backstop for your api which should be your single entry point to 
          your persistent store.

          Joi is a module that focuses on server-side validation in nodejs using a declarative chainable
          interface to declare your validation rules.

          > Joi is not the only game intown, there is JSON Schema.
