            They are very similar one is optimized for the server and one is optimized for the
            client. They are declarative, it is very easy to read and see what is going on.
            It is easy to add additional rules over time. And with Yup it is easy to add
            localization, and customization. Joi customization is possible, but it is a bit
            more involved. My opinion is that these schemas are much easier to manage 
            and provide precise rules, than that of a JSON Schema. JSON Schemas are good, 
            but the ease of Joi and Yup can't be beat.

            I think all solutions are great, just be sure to use a solution that provides

            * ServerSide Validation
            * Form/Inline Validation
